</p><h4>
INTRUSION DETECTOR LEARNING</h4>
Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from
unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders.&nbsp; The intrusion detector
learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable
of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks,
and ``good'' normal connections.

<p>The 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program was prepared and
managed by MIT Lincoln Labs. The objective was to survey and evaluate research
in intrusion detection.&nbsp; A standard set of data to be audited, which
includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment,
was provided.&nbsp; The 1999 KDD intrusion detection contest uses a version
of this dataset.

</p><p>Lincoln Labs set up an environment to acquire nine weeks of raw TCP
dump data for a local-area network (LAN) simulating a typical U.S. Air
Force LAN.&nbsp; They operated the LAN as if it were a true Air Force environment,
but peppered it with multiple attacks.

</p><p>The raw training data was about four gigabytes of compressed binary
TCP dump data from seven weeks of network traffic.&nbsp; This was processed
into about five million connection records.&nbsp; Similarly, the two weeks
of test data yielded around two million connection records.

</p><p>A connection is a sequence of TCP packets starting and ending at some
well defined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP address
to a target IP address under some well defined protocol.&nbsp; Each connection
is labeled as either normal, or as an attack, with exactly one specific
attack type.&nbsp; Each connection record consists of about 100 bytes.

</p><p>Attacks fall into four main categories:
</p><ul>
<li>
DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood;</li>

<li>
R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password;</li>

<li>
U2R:&nbsp; unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g.,
various ``buffer overflow'' attacks;</li>

<li>
probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning.</li>
</ul>
It is important to note that the test data is not from the same probability
distribution as the training data, and it includes specific attack types
not in the training data.&nbsp; This makes the task more realistic.&nbsp;
Some intrusion experts believe that most novel attacks are variants of
known attacks and the "signature" of known attacks can be sufficient to
catch novel variants.&nbsp; The datasets contain a total of 24 <a href="http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/training_attack_types">training
attack types</a>, with an additional 14 types in the test data only.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
DERIVED FEATURES</h4>
Stolfo et al. defined higher-level features that help in distinguishing
normal connections from attacks.&nbsp; There are several categories of
derived features.

<p>The ``same host'' features examine only the connections in the past
two seconds that have the same destination host as the current connection,
and calculate statistics related to protocol behavior, service, etc.

</p><p>The similar ``same service'' features examine only the connections in
the past two seconds that have the same service as the current connection.

</p><p>"Same host" and "same service" features are together called&nbsp; time-based
traffic features of the connection records.

</p><p>Some probing attacks scan the hosts (or ports) using a much larger time
interval than two seconds, for example once per minute.&nbsp; Therefore,
connection records were also sorted by destination host, and features were
constructed using a window of 100 connections to the same host instead
of a time window.&nbsp; This yields a set of so-called host-based traffic
features.

</p><p>Unlike most of the DOS and probing attacks, there appear to be no sequential
patterns that are frequent in records of R2L and U2R attacks. This is because
the DOS and probing attacks involve many connections to some host(s) in
a very short period of time, but the R2L and U2R attacks are embedded in
the data portions
<br>of packets, and normally involve only a single connection.

</p><p>Useful algorithms for mining the unstructured data portions of packets
automatically are an open research question.&nbsp; Stolfo et al. used domain
knowledge to add features that look for suspicious behavior in the data
portions, such as the number of failed login attempts.&nbsp; These features
are called ``content'' features.

</p><p>A complete listing of the set of features defined for the connection
records is given in the three tables below.&nbsp; The data schema of the
contest dataset is available in <a href="http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.names">machine-readable
